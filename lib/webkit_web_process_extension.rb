# Ruby bindings for the WebKit 6.0 web process extension API.
#
# Nothing here wraps a C function by hand. The library ships a GObject
# Introspection typelib, `WebKitWebProcessExtension-6.0.typelib`, describing every class, method, property
# and signal it has, and ruby-gnome's GObjectIntrospection::Loader reads that at
# require time and defines the Ruby classes from it. {WebKitWebProcessExtension::Loader} is about
# twenty lines; what you get is the whole library, and it does not drift when
# the library gains API.
#
# This is how ruby-gnome itself ships gtksourceview5, libsecret and the rest.
#
# The typelib has to be findable at require time, which means the library's
# `girepository-1.0` directory on `GI_TYPELIB_PATH` or in the system default.
# This gem cannot install it -- it is a C library artefact and belongs to the
# distribution. See the README; `flake.nix` wires up a dev shell that has it.
#
# One trap, paid for already: the typelib must come from the same glib build as
# the `gobject-introspection` gem. Mix two and GIO is registered twice in one
# process, which fails as `cannot register existing type 'GTlsCertificate'`.
