module WebKitWebProcessExtension
  # Defines everything in the WebKitWebProcessExtension namespace from `WebKitWebProcessExtension-6.0.typelib`.
  #
  # Modelled on ruby-gnome's own loaders -- see
  # gtksourceview5/lib/gtksourceview5/loader.rb for one that has to call the
  # library's init function before anything works, and
  # libsecret/lib/libsecret/loader.rb for one that does not.
  #
  # The version string is the typelib's, which is not always the library's
  # release number and is not guessable: this one is "6.0", read off
  # `WebKitWebProcessExtension-6.0.typelib` rather than inferred.

      # for exactly that purpose.
