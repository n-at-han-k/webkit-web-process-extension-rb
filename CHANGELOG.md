## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.1] - 2026-11-03

### Fixed

- `require "webkit-web-process-extension"` now works. The gem name contains a dash and the library
  does not, so the entry point was only reachable as `require "webkit_web_process_extension"` and the
  gem's own name failed with `cannot load such file -- webkit-web-process-extension`. Found the way it
  should be: a port added this gem as a dependency and could not load it. Both
  the gem name and the nested path RubyGems infers from a dash now resolve.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-11-03

### Fixed

- `require "webkit-web-process-extension"` now works. The gem name contains a dash and the library
  does not, so the entry point was only reachable under its underscored name
  and `require "webkit-web-process-extension"` failed with `cannot load such file -- webkit-web-process-extension`. Found by
  a port that depended on this gem and could not load it. Both the gem's own
  name and the nested path RubyGems infers from a dash now resolve.
