# webkit-web-process-extension

Ruby bindings for the WebKit 6.0 web process extension API.

```ruby
require "webkit_web_process_extension"

WebKitWebProcessExtension.constants.size  # the whole namespace, from the typelib
```

## How this works, and why there is nothing to compile

webkitgtk_6_0 ships a GObject Introspection typelib that describes every class,
method, property and signal it has. `WebKitWebProcessExtension::Loader` — twenty lines — hands that
typelib to ruby-gnome's `GObjectIntrospection::Loader`, which defines the Ruby
classes from it at `require` time.

So this gem is pure Ruby: no extension of its own, no Cargo workspace, no
per-platform binary. You get the whole library rather than the subset somebody
got round to wrapping by hand, and it does not drift when webkitgtk_6_0 gains API.

It is worth being precise about what that does and does not buy you at install
time. `gem install webkit-web-process-extension` still compiles C, because `gobject-introspection` and
`glib2` are themselves native extensions built against glib — so a compiler and
glib's development headers are needed. What this gem adds on top of that is
nothing: those two are what every ruby-gnome application already has, since
`gtk4` depends on them. If you are writing a Ruby GTK app, webkit_web_process_extension costs you no
build step you were not already paying.

This is how [ruby-gnome](https://github.com/ruby-gnome/ruby-gnome) itself ships
gtksourceview5, libsecret and the rest.

A typelib exists, so the namespace loads. Whether it is *usable* is another matter: this API is a shared library WebKit dlopens inside its own web process, and a Ruby gem in the application process cannot be one. It is bound because the gap asked for it; read the README before depending on it.

**Read this before depending on it.** A typelib exists, so the namespace loads. Whether it is *usable* from Ruby is another matter: this API is a shared library WebKit dlopens inside its own web process, and a Ruby gem in the application process cannot be one. It is bound because the gap asked for it.

## The one thing you must install

The typelib is a C-library artefact, so it belongs to your distribution and
this gem cannot install it:

| | |
|---|---|
| Debian / Ubuntu | `gir1.2-webkitwebprocessextension-6.0` |
| Fedora | `webkitgtk6.0` |
| Arch | `webkit2gtk-6.0` |
| nix | `pkgs.webkitgtk_6_0` |

If it is not in the default search path, point `GI_TYPELIB_PATH` at the
directory holding `WebKitWebProcessExtension-6.0.typelib`. The dev shell in `flake.nix` does this.

**One trap worth knowing.** The typelib must come from the same glib build as
the `gobject-introspection` gem. Mixing two registers GIO twice in one process
and fails with `cannot register existing type 'GTlsCertificate'`. Under nix,
take both from one nixpkgs — and note that glib's typelibs are in its `out`
output, not the default `bin` one.

## Using it from a flake

The gem needs `WebKitWebProcessExtension-6.0.typelib` and everything that typelib declares, resolved
transitively by the loader at `require` time. A missing one surfaces as
`Typelib file for namespace 'X' not found`, one at a time, so the whole chain
is listed here rather than discovered by repeated failure:

- `pkgs.webkitgtk_6_0` — its typelib, which is where `WebKitWebProcessExtension-6.0.typelib` lives
- `pkgs.glib` — GLib-2.0, GObject-2.0 and Gio-2.0, which nearly every GNOME typelib declares

Note the `.out`: a package's default output is often `bin`, which carries no
typelibs. `makeSearchPath` takes the first output, so it has to be asked for
`out` explicitly — this is the single most common way to get a search path that
looks right and finds nothing.

```nix
{
  inputs.nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";

  outputs = { nixpkgs, ... }:
    let
      system = "x86_64-linux";
      pkgs = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.${system};

      typelibPath = pkgs.lib.makeSearchPath "lib/girepository-1.0"
        (map (drv: drv.out or drv) [ pkgs.webkitgtk_6_0 pkgs.glib ]);
    in
    {
      devShells.${system}.default = pkgs.mkShell {
        packages = [ pkgs.ruby_3_4 pkgs.bundler ] ++ [ pkgs.webkitgtk_6_0 pkgs.glib ];

        shellHook = ''
          export GI_TYPELIB_PATH="${typelibPath}''${GI_TYPELIB_PATH:+:$GI_TYPELIB_PATH}"
        '';
      };
    };
}
```

Everything must come from **one** nixpkgs. A typelib built against a different
glib than the `gobject-introspection` gem registers GIO twice in the process
and fails with `cannot register existing type 'GTlsCertificate'`.

If you are packaging an application rather than entering a shell, the same
`typelibPath` goes on the wrapper:

```nix
makeWrapper ${ruby}/bin/ruby $out/bin/my-app \
  --set GI_TYPELIB_PATH "${typelibPath}"
```

## Development

```sh
nix develop
bin/test
```

## Releasing

```sh
gem kit release
```

That is the whole thing. It gates on the changelog having an entry for this
version, on no deprecation deadline coming due, and on a clean working tree;
then builds, pushes and tags.

There is nothing to wait for in CI. This gem is pure Ruby, so `gem build`
produces one `webkit_web_process_extension-X.Y.Z.gem` that is the same artefact wherever it is built —
no extension, no per-platform gems, nothing for a workflow to hand back.

copies no webkitgtk_6_0 code — it reads a description of it at runtime.
